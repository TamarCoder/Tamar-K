🔥 Work Experience

💼 From Operations to Development

Before transitioning into front-end development, I built a strong foundation in **software operations management** and **healthcare economics**.  
These roles sharpened my **problem-solving mindset** and taught me how to optimize systems for better performance and efficiency.

🛠️ One of the key projects I led involved **digitizing a clinic's administrative workflow**, which delivered measurable improvements:

- ⏱️ **30% reduction** in processing time  
- 📈 **20–25% increase** in user engagement  
- 🚀 Improved **service speed** and **customer satisfaction**

This experience continues to shape the way I approach frontend engineering: with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and real-world impact.


 💻 Frontend Developer Intern  
 
As a Frontend Developer Intern, I’m actively contributing to building web interfaces using **modern front-end technologies** such as:

- 🔹 **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React.js**
- 🎨 Translating UI/UX designs into responsive and interactive components
- 🔗 Integrating APIs and handling asynchronous data
- 🧠 Optimizing code for performance and accessibility
- 🧪 Participating in testing and maintaining code quality
